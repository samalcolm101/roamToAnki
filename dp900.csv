"Data for BLANK is collected over time, often from different data sources, and it is processed as a dataset that includes a range of rows or all rows in the dataset. It is designed to handle processing of large dataset. There is typically a long latency between data collection and data processing.",Batch Processing,DP900
BLANK is designed for real-time or near real-time processing often as a data load process with minimal processing. Data is either processed as it is generated or in micro-batches of a very few rows with latency of no more than a few milliseconds (very short latency).,Stream Processing,DP900
