Uses of this service include: Text Extraction: Analyze images and PDF documents that contain text and extract the text into a structured format.,Computer Vision,"AI900,UseCase,v2"
"Uses of this service include: Spatial Analysis: Identify people or objects, such as cars, in a space and map their movement within that space.",Computer Vision,"AI900,UseCase,v2"
"Services for this workload in Microsoft Azure include: Language Service, Translator Service, Speech Service and Azure Bot Service",Natural Language Processing,AI900
"Metrics to evaluate this model include mean absolute error, R squared and root mean squared error",Regression,"AI900,Fact"
(A form of) Supervised machine learning technique used to predict categories or classes.,Classification,"AI900,Definition,v2"
A confusion matrix is one method of scoring and evaluating this type of model,Classification,"Fact,AI900"
Recall and precision can be used to evaluate this type of model,Classification,"AI900,Fact"
Can run and create Jupyter notebooks to author machine learning projects but does not support the use of C,Azure Machine Learning Studio,"or,.NET.,AI900,Fact"
"Under the Computer Vision service umbrella, the BLANK service extracts text from images. You can use the new Read API to extract printed and handwritten text from photos and documents. It uses deep-learning-based models and works with text on a variety of surfaces and backgrounds. These include business documents, invoices, receipts, posters, business cards, letters, and whiteboards. The BLANK APIs support extracting printed text in several languages.",Optical Character Recognition (OCR),"AI900,v2"
"This will return a list of entities, categories and confidence scores following analysis of text.",entity recognition,"AI900,v2"
This service uses neural machine translation to translate whole sentences.,Translator service,"AI900,Fact"
"The BLANK service unifies Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligence Service) and provides several new features as well. These features can either be: Pre-configured, which means the AI models that the feature uses are not customizable. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications, Customizable, which means you'll train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically.",Language service,"Fact,AI900"
This service requires both the App Service and Azure Cognitive Search resources,QnA Maker,AI900
"A BLANK provides a conversational interface in websites and applications. Use one to shift simple, repetitive tasks to automated systems that don't require human interaction.",Bots,"Definition,AI900"
"Deliver BLANK via web interface, email, Microsoft Teams and more.",Bots,"AI900,Fact,v2"
"The BLANK web app has a guided, no-code graphical interface you can use to create chat bots. The interface eliminates the need for code-based or developer expertise.",Power Virtual Agents,"AI900,PL900,Definition"
"Three concepts make up BLANK; utterances, entities and intent.",LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligence Service),"Fact,AI900"
